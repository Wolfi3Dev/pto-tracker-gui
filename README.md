# PTO Tracker with GUI

*Before suing these steps be sure to `cd` into the directory that contains the `main.py` file*

Run with GUI option by running the command `python main.py -g` on windows or `pyton3 main.py -g` on mac

Running the application will initilize the creation of the `pto_data.json` file which will store your PTO requests locally on your machine.
